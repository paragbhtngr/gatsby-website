Yes, yes, I know you're probably expecting some inside joke or reference to start with, but before we get to that stuff, I want to talk a little bit about how language is parsed by humans. Language is a simplified representation of a thought or an idea, that we use to communicate to another human being. So say I have a thought in my head. That thought has multiple layers. To illustrate those layers, let's use an example: 

*It's very cold in this room. I do not like the cold. I know you like it cold. I am doing my best to accommodate your preferences because I want you to like me and I don't want to bother you too much, but I have a strong preference for it to be warmer. You have the remote control in your hands. I would like you to recognize that I am feeling cold and increase the temperature of the room. I say, "Bit cold, isn't it?".* 

So, I have asked a question - in four words, I've tried to express all of those thoughts and feelings to you (let's not even start to go down the rabbit holes that are why I want you to like me and why I'm too afraid to ask you directly). All that information. __ALL THAT__. 4 words. That is an incredibly lossy compression.

Picture another scene: 

*You are a super spy sent to defeat me and stop my diabolical scheme to take over the world. You wake up after being knocked out to find yourself tied up in a giant aquarium glass contraption filled with ice, tied up and drowning. I approach the glass cube with a sadistic smile on my face, as I watch you struggle as the life ebbs away from you, slowly. You see me mouth the words, "Bit cold, isn't it?"*

See? Same 4 words, completely different meanings. Language is an extremely low fidelity way of communicating without context, which is so important. Of course, if I was to just say those 4 words to you without giving you any context at all, you would have conjured up a completely unique context for it on your own. 

Language is extremely powerful - it is how I'm communicating (or my best attempt, anyway) this idea I have in my head to yours. It is also incredibly low bandwidth. This is why pictures are worth a thousand words. But the correct words can function as a shorthand for so much more. We are all human beings. We all live on this planet called Earth. We share so much in terms of our culture, our history, our beliefs and values. These are things that uniquely identify us as human beings inhabiting this planet in this timeframe. Our shared context provides us with a shorthand that we can access using language (not only language, but we'll get to that later). 

Let me elaborate further: computers have some understanding of the syntactic structure of language, but do not share the semantics of it. This can be tested using something called the Winograd schema, and I'll let Tom Scott explain that to you here.

Done? Too lazy? Fine. To use a very simple example, "The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence" is a sentence that a computer would have trouble understanding. To a human, _they_ is very clearly the city councilmen, because we know what demonstrators are and what they do and what city councilmen are. We understand enough about how people organize themselves into societal structures, about government at a local scale and about human nature to understand the semantics of that sentence. Shorthand for a lifetime's worth of experiences living as a human on this planet. Something a computer simply cannot understand. 

So you're thinking, fine computers are stupid. Yes well, it's not just computers though. Say we were to meet an alien species that spoke English and asked them "What's up?". They'd be staring at the ceiling for a while before we explained to them that we were asking how they were. And it's not just aliens. Try asking your grandmother to "Google" something. The word "smol" may be completely meaningless to you or may just have conjured up the cutest images ever.

The words we use are all representations of abstract constructs in our head. Every single word points to some idea in a person's head and that idea can be linked to so many things - emotions, memories, their personal identity, and so on. Some words and ideas are more powerful or emotionally significant than others. Sometimes, a specific way of saying something might trigger a memory or an emotion that was unintended. If you imagine your brain as a spider-web (no I'm not saying that it's so empty that you have cobwebs in there. I would never imply such a thing!), then me saying a word is like pulling on one end of it that pulls on everything it's connected to. So if I were to say we need to find a helicopter, it might not trigger much. On the other hand, if I said **"GET TO DA CHOPPA!"**. That, my friends, is a reference.
