Designing personal branding is a bitch - I spent ages thinking about what kind of image would best describe my art and design. At the time, I did a lot of comic book art and portraits. These were the two visual influences that informed the design of the logo.

It incorporates the visual elements of the letter P, the eyes, which are usually my starting point for a portrait, and the San Diego Comic-Con logo. I made 2 versions, one with a white chrome look that's a bit unfashionable these days given attitudes to skeuomorphic design, so I created a flatter version of the design in black.
