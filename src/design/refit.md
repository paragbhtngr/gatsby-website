Refit Equipments Pvt Ltd was an orthopaedics manufacturing and distribution company. The logo was a redesign of a draft logo made early in the creation of the company, and prominently featured red as its primary color and blue as its secondary color. I decided to keep the red primary color in the design of the new logo. For the shape I looked at other players in the orthopaedics industry, who all seemed to feature active figures jumping or stretching with their arms out. I wanted to incorporate that shape and visual style into the logo. The three visual elements I combined to form the logo were the letter R, a double arrow chevron to denote moving forward and upward and the general curve and feel of the active human form in logos from similar companies in the industry.

A flat version of the design was also created for printing on small objects and packaging where high quality versions of the logo could not be used.
