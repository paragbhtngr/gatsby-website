A series of illustrations I did for a project called VITA - a tablet-based activity program to help non-expert caregivers facilitate engagement activities for long-term care residents who have dementia. It comprises a resident’s profile, containing tips for interaction and information for volunteers to quickly get to know their resident’s abilities, preferences, languages spoken, as well as a customised activity guide tailored to each resident’s ability level and interests.

I also created an animated video to the effect of explaining the procedure to new users. The video can be viewed here
