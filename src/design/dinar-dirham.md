I've been working with DinarDirham as a designer and front-end developer for a while now, and in that time, I've designed their website, which you can see live here.

I have also designed and implemented the front end for a crypto wallet/exchange called Universal Bitcoin Wallet (name was not my idea) and you can find it at here.
